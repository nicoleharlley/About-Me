## About Me

Hi, I am Nicole (she/her)! I have a background in finance, statistics and economics. A year ago whilst working as a consultant, I realized that I wanted to focus my efforts on adding value and building technology based solutions. 

Currently, I am continuing to build the necessary skills to build these solutions by working on interesting tech projects. Most of the projects I have worked on are focus on the financial sector which allows me to leverage my education and experience. Check out some of my projects!
